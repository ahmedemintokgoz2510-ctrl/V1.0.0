### Installation

1. **Extract the project**
   ```bash
   unzip crazy_block_online.zip
   cd crazy_block_online
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Platform-Specific Setup

For Android:
```bash
flutter run -d android
```

For iOS:
```bash
flutter run -d ios
```

## Important Notes for V0.5

### Not Yet Implemented (Planned for V1+)
- Actual Block Blast gameplay logic
- Flame game engine integration
- Online multiplayer matches
- Real backend authentication (Firebase)
- Real-time leaderboards
- In-app purchases and real coin economy
- Audio playback (SFX/Music) - toggles work, no actual audio files
- Notifications system
- Cloud save/sync

### Current Limitations
- Game board is a placeholder grid
- No actual block placement/clearing mechanics
- No real-time online features
- Player data stored locally (session-based)
- Market items are empty (for future implementation)
- No actual purchase transactions

## Architecture for Future Development

### For Flame Integration (V1)
The `GameScreen` is structured to easily integrate Flame:

1. Replace the placeholder grid with a Flame `GameWidget`
2. Create game logic classes for:
   - Block management
   - Grid state
   - Collision detection
   - Line clearing
   - Scoring system

3. Use existing `GameStateProvider` for score/coins synchronization

### For Backend Integration
The `GameStateProvider` is designed to be replaced with actual backend calls:
- Replace mock friend lists with Firebase queries
- Replace local player storage with Firebase Auth
- Add Firestore for persistent player data
- Implement Cloud Functions for game logic

## Customization

### Colors & Theme
Edit `/lib/theme/app_theme.dart` to customize:
- Primary colors
- Block colors
- Gradients
- Text styles
- Shadows and effects

### Screens
Each screen is modular and can be:
- Modified independently
- Themed separately
- Connected to different navigation flows

### State Management
All app state flows through `GameStateProvider`:
```dart
// Access state
final gameState = context.read<GameStateProvider>();

// Listen to changes
Consumer<GameStateProvider>(
  builder: (context, gameState, child) { ... }
)

// Modify state
gameState.addScore(100);
gameState.toggleMusic();
gameState.addFriend(friend);
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Loading screen animation works
- [x] Login/account creation screens functional
- [x] All navigation works correctly
- [x] Settings toggles change state
- [x] Player ID and name display correctly
- [x] Score starts at 0 (no hardcoded data)
- [x] Social tabs display properly
- [x] Market shows empty state
- [x] Language selection works
- [x] All buttons have proper animations
- [x] No reference image data is hardcoded
- [x] UI uses real Flutter widgets (no screenshots)

## Next Steps (V1 Development)

1. **Integrate Flame Game Engine**
   - Build game board with Flame components
   - Implement block physics
   - Add particle effects

2. **Implement Gameplay**
   - Block placement logic
   - Line clearing algorithm
   - Scoring system with combos

3. **Backend Connection**
   - Firebase authentication
   - Firestore for player data
   - Cloud Functions for validation

4. **Audio System**
   - Implement actual SFX playback
   - Background music
   - Respect audio toggles from settings

5. **Multiplayer**
   - Real-time game invitations
   - Live match mechanics
   - Leaderboard system

## File Size & Performance

- Minimal dependencies (provider, shared_preferences)
- No unnecessary assets
- Optimized animations
- ~15-20MB final APK (without Flame)
